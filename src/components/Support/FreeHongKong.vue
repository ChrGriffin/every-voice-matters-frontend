        <h2>#FreeHongKong</h2>
        <p>In February of 2019, the Legislative Council of Hong Kong proposed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hong_Kong_extradition_bill#From_bill_suspension_to_withdrawal">extradition bill</a> that was viewed by many as a dangerous loophole that would allow the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) to arrest political dissidents taking shelter in Hong Kong, as well as opening Hong Kong's democratic government to influence from the CCP. This resulted in mass protests.</p>
        <p>The initial protests were characterized by the government of Hong Kong as "riots" (later protests would, in fact, become riots). A sharply escalating police response resulted in multiple reports of police brutality and misconduct. Notably, both a journalist and a teacher had their eyes shot by rubber and beanbag rounds, respectively; the journalist was permanently blinded in his right eye. This has resulted in the covered eye, or eye patch, becoming a symbol of the Hong Kong protests.</p>
        <p>The protestors organized around 5 demands they made of the Legislative Council (eventually resulting in the slogan, "5 Demands, Not One Less"):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill;</li>
            <li>Retraction of the characterization of the initial protests as "riots";</li>
            <li>Release and exoneration of imprisoned protestors;</li>
            <li>A public commission of inquiry into police conduct;</li>
            <li>And the resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam and implementation of universal suffrage for Hong Kong elections.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As of September 2019, Carrie Lam has promised to officially withdraw the bill in October 2019, but has dismissed the protestors' other four demands.</p>
        <h3>How you can Help</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, there's isn't much that Western activists can do to directly help the Hong Kong protestors. The protestors are not a centralized or formal organization; there's no single group to donate money to. Here's what you <span class="italic">can</span> do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continue pressuring Blizzard Activision, and other Western corporations, to withdraw their support (whether implicit or explicit) from the CCP</li>
            <li>Donate to the <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/support-hkfp/" target="_blank">Hong Kong Free Press</a></li>
            <li>Donate to a cause on <a href="">GoFundMe</a>; many protestors have been seeking funding for medical and legal bills, in addition to journalistic and larger relief efforts (as ever, research carefully before donating to a potentially fraudulent fundraiser)</li>
        </ul>
